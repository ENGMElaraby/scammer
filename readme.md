# Scammer Laravel Package
This is a simple package aiming to solve the issue of a scammer , the scammer in this context is a customer not willing to pay the developer and trying to steal the developer
work .
## Installation
``` composer require fania/scammer ```
## Usage
After installing the package remember to publish the config file <br>
``` php artisan vendor:publish --tag scammer-config ``` <br>
it's Very important that you publish the config file , otherwise the package can't work.<br>
You can use the package in two ways , either in the command line
``` php artisan scammer:kill {type} ```
<br>
this method is useful if you lost access to the files but still have an SSH access of some kind.
 <br>
 However , the main usage of this package is when you completely lose access to the site , and the only permissions you have is what any other user has .to Solve this you will have access to new route **/kill-site** and you can continue from there
